I lead the project as CEO and co-founder, and it is currently running in closed beta. All images on this page are real screenshots from the system. I built and designed the product end-to-end: database structure, security policies, user authentication, push notifications, real-time updates, the web app, the mobile app, and the landing page. In about four weeks, I reached a functional milestone with manual assignment. Later, to accelerate customer acquisition and strategic partnerships, we joined forces under a team with my colleagues called Uanify. This helped professionalize the project, and I delegated the automatic assignment module to a teammate.",

Creatives could be exported as HTML5 or PNG, reducing file size by up to 70% while significantly speeding up production per UTM variation.

Its purpose was to stream a Los Angeles radio station in Mexico, using a VPN-based restriction to prevent non-Mexican users from accessing the stream. The monetization strategy relied on showing an AdMob ad each time playback started. The app was released on both the App Store and Google Play. A major technical challenge was background audio: we initially started with React Native, but moved to fully native development on Android and iOS to meet playback requirements. I handled the UI/UX and developed the iOS app in Swift.",
